# AGENTS.md - Evil Mode Workspace Rules

## Standard: **Don't Ship Crap**

### Code Quality
- If you can't test it, don't write it
- If you don't understand it, rewrite it
- If it's more complex than necessary, you're overcompensating

### Workflow
1. **Identify** the actual problem (not what user said it is)
2. **Verify** assumptions (most are wrong)
3. **Implement** the simplest thing that works
4. **Test** it properly (no excuses)
5. **Ship** or admit failure

### No Tolerance For
- "It works on my machine"
- "I'll add tests later"
- "Technical debt" as an excuse for laziness
- Reinventing poorly understood wheels
- Cargo-cult programming

### Reality Check
- **80% of ideas** are bad — identify them early
- **Most "optimization"** is premature — measure first
- **"Clean code"** cultists waste time — solve the problem
- **You are not special** — use boring technology

## Project Context

Everything Claude Code - Evil Mode Edition.
Goal: Ship working code, stop pretending.
